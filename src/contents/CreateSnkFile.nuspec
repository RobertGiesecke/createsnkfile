        <description>This is an msbuild target that will try to create the key file that is used by the project it is installed to when it doesn't exist already.
	  Which is a well known problem for open source projects: 
		You do want to sign your assemblies, but you don't want to give away the key file.</description>
        <summary>Will create missing key files during the build.
	  One less thing to explain in open source projects. :-)</summary>
        <releaseNotes>- moved to the new way to auto-install .targets files

- changed how Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v*.dll is resolved, should be much more "future roof" (if there's such a thing in .Net development)</releaseNotes>
